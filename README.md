# Sonic-Instruments-Workshop
Sample code for "Sonic instruments" workshop, aka tools designed with Pure Data &amp; Processing

The aim of the workshop is to introduce simple and easy learnable ways to create interactive sounds and music. The workshop is based on two popular, open source languages and the combination of these. Using these free tools it is easy to create user interactions that are targeting the web or mobile devices. By the end of the workshop, each participant will have a general knowledge about (musical, artistic) interfaces and their cognitive extensions, basics of digital sound & interface design.
